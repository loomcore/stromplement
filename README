stromplement v0.0.1

Silly little Chicken Scheme hack to "complement" a string.

The Roman alphabet is encoded as 5-bit integers (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.), modulo 26 (25=Z, 26=A, 27=B, etc.).  stromplement takes a string, encodes and complements each character, then decodes it to a new string.  Spaces are left untouched, and case is ignored.
